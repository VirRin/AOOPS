# Text Based RolePlaying Game

This project was part of my Advanced Object Oriented Programming Course.
My idea originated from my obsession with games, Creating a game seemed fun, a hectic task but fun. 
So i chose to create a simple choice based- text based role playing game, that too an app...

I used Android Studio and Java programming language to make this game.
Its a very small game but i had the best time working on it.
